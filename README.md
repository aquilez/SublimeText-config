# Configuration for SublimeText 3

This is my personal configuration for SublimeText 3.
To install, clone repo into the Packages directory (accesible via "Browse Packages" option in the Preferences Menu).

You may need to configure the following plugins:

* CodeComplice and SublimeLinter: set the path to the PHP binary
* xDebug Client: set folder mapping if connecting to an external server (like a vagrant instance)

## Notes

* Font used: Source Code Pro at 12px
* Lot of language packages are disabled
* Default line ending is set to unix-style
* Tab size is set at 4 spaces.
* Indentation is autodetected by Sublime
* EditorConfig plugin in installed to force per-project settings
